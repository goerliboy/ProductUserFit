**What is Product-User Fit Framework?**

It’s a tool built for crypto startup founders and marketers who want to stop guessing and start aligning.
It helps you understand *how much crypto knowledge* your users actually need to make sense of your product.

**Here’s how it works:**
* You answer 18 questions about your product; how clear the concept is, how much it relies on crypto-native primitives etc.
* It gives a Friction Index Score (_how difficult your product is_) and tailored insights based on the score:

  * Product Intepretation
  * Category Radar Chart (_visual breakdown of your product's complexity across different knowledge domains_)
  * Ideal User Profile (_experience level, knowledge base, behavior, expectations_)
  * Onboarding Principles
  * Marketing Strategy (_key focus areas, content strategy_)
  * Growth Tactics
  * Similar to your products (_soon_)

In short: it tells you *who* your product is really for and how to talk to them.
