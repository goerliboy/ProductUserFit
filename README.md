## What is this?

The Product-User Fit Framework helps crypto startup founders, growth and product teams answer one deceptively hard question:

> _"Do my users actually understand what we’ve built?"_

If you’ve shipped features, launched campaigns, or revamped onboarding, only to watch users bounce, this tool is for you.


## How it works

1. **Answer 18 questions** about your product’s concept clarity, reliance on crypto-native mechanics, and user-facing complexity.
2. Get a **Friction Index Score**, a quantitative measure of how hard your product is to understand.
3. Receive a tailored, actionable report that includes:

   - **Product Interpretation Summary**
   - **Category Radar Chart** — visual complexity mapping
   - **Ideal User Profile** – experience, expectations, and behavior
   - **Growth Tactics** – your product’s traction levers
   - *Onboarding Principles [WIP]*
   - *Marketing Strategy [WIP]*
   - *Similar Products [WIP]*


## Why this matters

Product-User Fit is what happens before Product-Market Fit. It tells you:
- Who your product is really for
- What your user *needs to know* to make sense of it
- How to align UX, onboarding, and GTM strategy to reduce confusion and increase adoption

## Methodology: How the Framework Was Built

To calibrate the **Product-User Fit Framework**, I conducted an audit (UI,UX,GTM) crypto products from a wide range of categories from the instantly intuitive to the “_what the hell is this even?_” tier.

Each product was assessed for:
- Conceptual clarity
- Reliance on crypto-native primitives
- Expected user knowledge
- Onboarding friction

Based on this, I assigned a **Difficulty Score** (1–10) and categorized each product accordingly.
